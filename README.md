# bugle_call
Converted to tones and played using jsgame0.js

I wanted to sound "Taps" through tones using jsgame0.js.
Looking for the sheet music to Taps introduced me to the wider world of bugle calls.

The bugle can sound a harmonic series of 6 notes (C4, G4, C5, E5, G5, C6).
This limited number of single notes with no chords and the large number of bugle calls translate well to a rhythm action game.
A rhythm action game is simple: just detect if a key is pressed at the correct time.
The hard part is licensing the rights to the music.
Thankfully, the Manual For Buglers U.S. Navy solved this problem.
